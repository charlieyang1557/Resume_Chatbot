## Machine Learning Projects

### Real-time Anomaly Detection System
Built a comprehensive anomaly detection pipeline for API telemetry data at PTC Onshape. Implemented multiple algorithms including Prophet for time series forecasting, Isolation Forest for outlier detection, and LSTM-AE for deep learning-based anomaly detection. The system achieved 95% accuracy in detecting API performance anomalies and reduced manual monitoring by 80%.

Technologies: Python, Prophet, Isolation Forest, Merlion, LSTM, AWS Bedrock, Claude 3.5 Sonnet

### Customer Churn Prediction Model
Developed a Random Forest-based churn prediction model at Pinecone that identified key customer behavior patterns. The model analyzed 15+ customer metrics and achieved 87% accuracy in predicting churn risk. Implemented automated alerts and dashboard visualizations that helped reduce customer churn by 10%.

Technologies: Python, Scikit-learn, Random Forest, SQL, BigQuery, Sigma

### Mushroom Classification Project
Team project building ML/DL models to classify mushrooms as edible vs poisonous using multiple approaches. Implemented Random Forest, Kernel SVM, and CNN models with grid search hyperparameter tuning. Applied transfer learning with pre-trained ResNet50 to improve efficiency and accuracy.

Technologies: Python, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, CNN, ResNet50, Grid Search

### Behavioral Analysis Research
Conducted research on procrastination and present-bias using GLM and Logistic Regression at UC Davis. Analyzed 20,000+ samples using bootstrapping techniques and addressed multicollinearity using Lasso regularization. Results provided insights for tech product design to enhance user satisfaction and retention.

Technologies: R, GLM, Logistic Regression, Bootstrapping, Lasso Regularization
