I specialize in building end-to-end ML pipelines, automating analytics workflows, and communicating findings with stakeholders across product, growth, and research teams. My technical expertise spans Python, SQL, R, and various ML frameworks including Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and time series analysis tools. I have hands-on experience with cloud platforms like AWS and GCP, data engineering tools like BigQuery and DBT, and visualization platforms including Tableau, Power BI, and Looker. In my recent role at PTC Onshape, I built unsupervised anomaly detection systems for API telemetry using Prophet, Isolation Forest, and LSTM-AE models. I also developed AI-powered NPS analysis pipelines using AWS Bedrock and Claude 3. 5 Sonnet for sentiment analysis and theme extraction. At Pinecone, I designed and built comprehensive dashboards that improved sales operations by 15% and developed churn analysis models using Random Forest that reduced churn by 10%.", "url": "https://charlieyang1557.github.io/aboutme/"}
