As a Data Analyst Intern at Allschool, he executed A/B tests and segmentation analyses on traffic and revenue, which suggests that he has hands-on experience with this type of analysis. Additionally, his research assistant role at UC Davis Department of Economics involved studying behavioural trends using logistic regression and GLMs, which implies that he is familiar with statistical experimentation methods.",
