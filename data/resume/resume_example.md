## Professional Experience
### Data Science Intern — Onshape by PTC (R&D Strategy) (Jun 2025 – Aug 2025, Boston, MA)
- Built and evaluated unsupervised anomaly detection models (Prophet with Isolation Forest, Merlion, LSTM autoencoder) for API telemetry monitoring; productionised the Prophet pipeline for strong performance and maintainability.
- Applied AWS Bedrock's Titan Embeddings and Claude 3.5 Sonnet to cluster, label, and analyse sentiment across NPS feedback, surfacing actionable themes from unstructured text.
- Conducted keyword coverage analysis on AI Advisor queries to identify reference URL gaps and inform content roadmap updates.
- Developed Looker dashboards and Slack automations that summarised anomaly alerts and AI insights, reducing manual monitoring overhead.

### Data Science Intern — Pinecone (Jun 2024 – Aug 2024, New York, NY)
- Designed the Book of Business and Account 360 dashboards with SQL and Sigma, boosting sales operations productivity by 15% and documenting processes to shorten onboarding by 30%.
- Developed the `dim_assistants` schema in BigQuery and dbt, then launched the Pinecone Assistant dashboard to monitor product metrics and enable cross-team insight sharing.
- Executed churn analysis in Python with Random Forest models, identifying five leading indicators and launching alerting that contributed to a 10% churn reduction while informing new data collection for higher fidelity signals.

### Data Analyst Intern — Allschool (Growth & BI) (Jun 2022 – Aug 2022, San Mateo, CA)
- Ran A/B tests and segmentation analyses on user traffic and revenue across regions and platforms, informing impression targeting and engagement strategies via Google Analytics.
- Evaluated multi-channel acquisition behaviour with SQL and BI tooling, trimming project budget by 15% while increasing daily active users.
- Built a Selenium-powered web scraper that accelerated class selection by 50% and delivered a Looker Studio dashboard tracking active users, traffic, and revenue.

### Research Assistant — UC Davis Department of Economics (Jul 2020 – Sep 2020, Davis, CA)
- Modelled procrastination and present-biased behaviour with generalised linear models and logistic regression under Professor Anujit Chakraborty.
- Applied bootstrapping to expand the analytical sample to roughly 20,000 observations, boosting statistical reliability.
- Used Lasso regularisation to address multicollinearity among predictors and strengthen behavioural predictions, translating findings into actionable insights for product teams focused on user retention.

## Projects
### Classification of Mushrooms: Edible or Poisonous (Python)
- Collaborated on machine learning and deep learning workflows—including Random Forest, Kernel SVM, and CNN architectures—to classify mushroom images.
- Applied grid search for hyperparameter optimisation and transfer learning with a pre-trained ResNet50 model to improve inference accuracy.
- Evaluated model performance and recommended future experiments exploring alternative pre-trained networks and architecture adjustments.

## Volunteering & Community
- Mentor, Women in Machine Learning (WiML) Mentorship Program.
- Organizer, Seattle Applied AI Meetup (1,200+ members).
